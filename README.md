This isn't actually as fast as it can be I recently figured out. If you want a bot that reads out the amount of SOL in LP in a loop every second in terminal and then just type a command to remove LP at any moment, add me on Discord: shadowystupidcoder

I don't want to make that one open source quite yet because it will be abused by bad actors I imagine
